# Repository for C++ practice  
This repository will be used to save C++ code written by me that cover basic concepts as well as interview practice questions.

# Folder Structure  
```
├───.vscode   Contains settings for VScode to build each file.
├───bin       Contains all executable files
└───src       Contains source files (.cpp)
```
